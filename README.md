# Great-Circles-Problem
Visualize 3D Great Circles on Sphere

The file "Demo.bmp" is how my visualization looks like. I started the program from the scratch like algorithm, math formulas to form circles in 3D.
One of the hard parts in this problem is to detect the intersections correctly. This required to have 3D geometry knowledge.
